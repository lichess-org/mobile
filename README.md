# Lichess Mobile

Second iteration of the [Lichess mobile app](https://lichess.org/mobile).

## How to contribute

The project is still in early stage of development. Drastic changes may still
happen, including project structure.

If you want to contribute, please read the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

Follow the [official flutter guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

**Note, if you're on Linux**, you should install flutter manually because there is an [issue](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile/issues/123) with snapd when building Stockfish.

This project is meant to run on iOS and Android, so you need to follow the
"Platform setup" section of that guide to install the iOS and/or Android platform.

Note that this project is not meant to be run on web platform.

### Using FVM for Flutter Version Management

If you want to use FVM to manage your Flutter versions effectively, please consult the [FVM (Flutter Version Management) guide](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation) for comprehensive instructions on installing Flutter on your specific operating system.

**Pro Tip:** Remember to prepend the 'flutter' prefix when using FVM commands, like this: `fvm flutter [command]`.

### Local lila

You will need a local [lila](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila) (lichess server scala app) instance to work on this
project. You will also need to setup [lila-ws](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila-ws) (websocket server).

Instructions to install both are found in [the lila wiki](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/wiki).

The mobile application is configured by default to target `http://127.0.0.1:9663` and `ws://127.0.0.1:9664`, so keep these when installing lila.

## Run

First run the code generator:

```sh
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner watch
```

Check you have some connected device with: `flutter devices`.

If you target an android device you need to run these commands so the device can reach the local lila instance:

```sh
adb reverse tcp:9663 tcp:9663
adb reverse tcp:9664 tcp:9664
```

Then run on your device:

```sh
flutter run -d <my_device> --flavor dev
```

You can find more information about emulators [in the wiki](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile/wiki/Setting-up-device-emulators).

You can find more information about the `flutter run` command by running `flutter run --help`.

### Test

Before submitting a pull request, please run the tests:

```sh
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

### Logging

```sh
dart devtools
```

Then run the app with the `flutter run` command above, and a link to the logging page will be printed in the console.

## Internationalisation

Do not edit the `app_en.arb` file by hand, this file is generated.
More information [in the wiki](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile/wiki/About-internationalisation).

## Releasing

Only for members of lichess team.

1. Bump the pubspec.yaml version number. This can be in a PR making a change or a separate PR. Use semantic versioning to determine which part to increment. The version number after the + should also be incremented. For example 0.3.3+000303 with a patch should become 0.3.4+000304.
2. Run workflow [Draft GitHub Release](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile/actions/workflows/draft_github_release.yml)
3. Run workflow [Deploy to Play Store](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile/actions/workflows/deploy_play_store.yml)
